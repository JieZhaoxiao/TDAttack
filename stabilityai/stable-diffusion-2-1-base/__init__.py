"""
Initializes and downloads the Stable Diffusion v2-1 model weights from Hugging Face.
Key functionality:
1. Checks if weights exist locally; skips download if already present.
2. Uses `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download` to fetch the model repository.
3. Stores weights in a subdirectory named 'stable_diffusion_v2_1'.
4. Ensures compatibility with the model's expected directory structure.
